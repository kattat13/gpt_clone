# ChatGPT clone
The repository contains my version of a clone of ChatGPT application implemented using Python (Flask), HTML and CSS (Bootstrap).
It's powered by OpenAI's __GPT-3.5__ model for conversational purposes and __DALL-E__ for creating images and art.

Demo available at: *link incoming*

## Usage
Just ask the chatbot anything you like in the textarea.<BR>
If you want to generate an image, simply type `img:` before describing your idea, for example `img: a massive hamster flying in the outer space`.

## Important note
You need OpenAI API key for the application to run. In the project's root folder create .env file containing following line:

`OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-key"`

where "your_key" is the API key you obtained from https://platform.openai.com
